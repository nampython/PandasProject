Introduction:
One of jobs that teachers have in common is "evaluting" students. Whether you use in exams, homework assignments, quizzes, or projects,...... You usually  have to turn student's scores into a "letter grade"  at the end of the term.This often "involves" "a bunch of calculations" that you might do in speardsheet.Instead, you can consider using Python and Pandas.
One problem with using a speardsheet is that it can be hard to see when you make a mistake in a formula. Maybe you selected the wrong column and put quizzes where exams should go. mayble you found the maximum of two incorrect values. To solve this problem, you can use Python and pandas to do all calculations and find and fix those mistakes much faster

=> what i will build: 

  In this pandas, i'm going to create a Python script  that loads your grade data and calculates "letter grades"
for your students

=> Project Overview:

 This project involves four main steps:
 1) Explore the data: You'll use in the project to determine  which format and data you'll need to calculate your final grades
 2) Load the data into pandas DataFrames, making sure to connect the grades the same student across all your data sources
 3) Calculate the final grades and save them as CSV file 
 4) Plot the grade distribution and explore how the grades vary among your students

Once you complete these steps, you'll have a working  Python script that can calculate your grades. Your grades will be in a format that you should be able to upload to your school's student  administration system.
